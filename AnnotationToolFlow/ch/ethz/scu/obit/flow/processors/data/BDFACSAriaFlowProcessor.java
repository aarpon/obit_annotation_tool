/**
 * BDLSRFortessaFlowProcessor parses folder structures created by the following
 * software and hardware combination:
 *
 * 1. BD FACSDiva software (6.1, 7.0, 8.0) on BD LSRFortessa and BD FACSAriaIII
 *
 * 2. BD FACSâ„¢ Sortware (1.2) on BD Influx Cell Sorter
 * 
 * Please notice that when exporting data from the FACSDiva software, there are
 * two options:
 *
 * 1) export as FCS files (supported)
 * 2) export as experiment (not supported)
 *
 * When exporting as experiment, the experiment metadata is written to an
 * additional XML file and not correctly stored in the FCS files. These FCS
 * files can not correctly be processed by flow analysis software like FlowJo.
 * For this reason, data exported as experiment from FACSDiva (i.e. with the
 * accompanying XML file) are flagged as invalid and are not processed.
