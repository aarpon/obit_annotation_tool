Copy the needed jre folder here. It is assumed here that the folder is called 'jre'.

In the AnnotationTool and AnnotationToolAdmin WinRun4J ini files set the path the the jre as follows.

For 32 bit:

vm.location=..\jre\bin\client\jvm.dll

For 64 bit:

vm.location=..\jre\bin\server\jvm.dll

Adapt the jre folder name if needed.
